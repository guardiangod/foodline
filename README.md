# Welcome to FoodLine
FoodLine is built for real life. For the young professional who gets home late and doesn’t have the energy to cook. For the student with an exam tomorrow and an empty fridge tonight. These aren’t exceptions — they’re everyday moments. That’s why FoodLine brings food and groceries to your door, fast, fresh, and right when you need them.

Customers struggle with:

- Cluttered browsing experiences that don’t understand their preferences.
- Limited customization when ordering meals or groceries.
- Unclear order status or delivery timelines.
- Poor payment experience, or failed checkouts.
- Lack of timely feedback channels to report a bad experience or appreciate a good one.

FoodLine was built not just as another delivery app, but as a thoughtful, technology-first platform that reimagines how essentials reach customers in the most seamless way.

The project requires Java 21. If you have multiple JVMs on your machine, you might want to 
consider using a tool such as [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) to handle switching between versions.

The project makes use of Gradle and uses the Gradle wrapper, which means you don't need Gradle installed.

### Installing Java

Install java using homeBrew
```console
brew install openjdk@21
```

Installing java on Windows, [refer](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.html#xd_co_f=NzA3YTZmNzAtOTEzMS00OWFiLTk2NjUtODg0NjNhMjRhMjkw~)
